# RockPaperScissors

reuse the exisiting project but add buttons for answer selection

what ive learned during this projects process

<!--
REVISITING PROJECT PART #2;

1) textContent will pickup /n new lines or spaces in text. which will render values for strict comparison unequal even when they have identical text

2) innerHTML used on elements that recieve unsantiszed user inputs are high rosk for js script injection. vulnerability can be hacked  using; img, element to inject js

3) Adding numbers to scores
us ++ instead of +=. += will just add the specified value inline ie; 0111. while ++ will add values to sum ie 0, 1, 2, etc.

4) The disabled propwrty is avaible every button element. set it equal to boolean
